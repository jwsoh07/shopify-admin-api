# Shopify Admin API Service
This repository is meant to keep a collection of all the useful API queries that fetches data from a Shopify store.

## 
A thin wrapper around the [@shopify/admin-api-client
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/admin-api-client) library has been created for easy usage of the Shopify admin API without the need to find out the required syntax for each of the many queries developers will need to make for data fetching.

You can find the wrapper class definition in `shopify-admin-api.js`
